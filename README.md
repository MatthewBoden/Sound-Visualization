Pressing the mouse button will pause and play the song. The code shows a techno song sound visualization that seamlessly translates various sound properties into visual changes. The code examines the audio amplitude using the amplitude object, capturing the audio signal's intensity. When the amplitude level exceeds 0.5, signifying a musical beat, the code initiates a series of captivating visual transformations, including adding more shapes to the screen and changing the background colour. The X and Y speed is mapped to the amplitude of the song to represent rapid changes. As a beat is detected, the background colour changes using lerp, introducing sudden and vivid shifts in the canvas's atmosphere, producing a striking and dynamic backdrop that pulsates with the music's rhythm. The code uses custom shapes as mini sound visualizers. The audio properties alter the characteristics of these shapes using FFT. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyzer extracts the audio's frequency spectrum. The size of these shapes is intricately mapped to the audio's amplitude, resulting in a visual oscillation that mirrors the musical dynamics. As the audio's amplitude shifts, the shapes fluctuate in size, ranging from small to big, providing a visually striking representation of the music's vitality. The visualization of the code is similar to a kaleidoscope with a polygon shape and many different changing colours with rapid changes to the song.
